# ü´∂ Karma Proof: Onchain proof for offchain good
Built at EthGlobal Prague Hackathon, May 2025

## The problem:
Too many real-world public good goes unrecognized and unrewarded, like donating blood, volunteering, planting trees, or cleaned up the beach. Governments and local organizations sometimes reward these efforts, but their programs are often limited to specific regions, depend on external funding, and require a lot of manual effort‚Äîmaking them hard to scale globally.

## Our solution:
We build Karma Proof app to bring real-world good deeds on chain. 
Using vlayer's email proof technology, users can upload their email showing their public good actions (e.g. donating to wikipedia) and turn them into onchain proof. In return, they earn Karma Points and soulbound NFTs. This allow users to build public reputation onchain, while earning real-world perks like discounts, free transport, or access to events.

We want makes good deeds Visible, Verifiable, Valued. Karma Proof is a step towards building a global public good system that‚Äôs transparent, scalable, and self-sustaining. 

#### Key Features
- Easy verification: Users upload .eml files to verify real-world actions.
- Karma points: non-transferable, soulbound ERC-20 tokens. Integrated with Blockscout Merit so that users can swap Karma points with Merits to access web3 perks/ airdrops.
- Soulbound NFTs: we designed six main NFT types to represent public good in different domains- Time, Care, Gift, Knowledge, Ecology, Access. 
- To encourage adoption, we designed gamified features like streaks, leaderboards, and campaigns (e.g., ‚ÄúBlood Donation Week‚Äù). User can also share Karma NFTs with friends on Twitter.
- Reward shop: users can spend Karma points to redeem web2 rewards globally.
